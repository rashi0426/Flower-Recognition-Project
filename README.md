# Flower-Recognition-Project
 • Developed a flower recognition system using machine learning to classify images into five categories: tulip,
 sunflower, dandelion, rose, and chamomile.
 • Utilized a dataset from Kaggle consisting of 4,242 flower images, performing data preprocessing including resizing
 and transformations with torchvision.
 • Implemented data loaders and GPU acceleration for efficient model training and validation.
 • Employed transfer learning with a pre-trained model to enhance classification accuracy, adjusting learning rates for
 optimal convergence.
 • Tested the model on individual images to evaluate performance and accuracy.
